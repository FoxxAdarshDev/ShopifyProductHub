so in shopify I have a

halo-product-tab.liquid

where I added this code

see the attached code

``

so under shopufy product description

I added this html

``
see 2nd attached code
`

so the issue is I have to add this html manually one by one to each sku and and it consume lot of time and sometimes we have additional tab also like see attached code 3

also in some see additional tab content

see attached code 4

~

so right now the issue is I have to manally going to each sku and add this html based on the requirement

but see many description tab are common and in some there is additional

so what you do

create a system using nodejs and react and utlize the shopify api

I have a shopify access token

seee of the shopify store

see

password: shpat_bf9cb13fb0847e311c4
theme_id: "13860328"
store: foxxbioprocess.myshopify.com

`

what I want is

smpley I have to ener sku

and one I enter there is the select box option in top where I hae to select the tab I want ot add in this sku

once I check this tab box form open where I simpley copy andpaste the descriptio, speciciatiom, videos datasheet and all

so basically

also if I want to create a new checkbox I do ti

so basoically I have a postgresql database instance also

so see

I added below

PGDATABASE="foxxbioprou_description"
PGHOST="dpg-d21p8eemcj7s73equ.render.com/foxxbioprocess_product_sku_description"
PGPASSWORD="swJXOW6toG4dubC3zR"
PGPORT="5432"
PGUSER="foxxbioprocesssku_description_user"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://foxxbioprocess_product_sku_description_user:swJXOW0nmqylMyfHIZsT6t8eemcj7s73equsqg-a.singapore-postgres.render.com/foxsku_description"

so once I add the data here what you do I need a standard layout for all so once I addd here you simply add the full html with data to that sku

using shopofy api I added I have all access product read write

also I have to add the logo url also so simple you can give two options one direcly enter the url

so once I enter this logo have added give multople logo url added under the tab content of logo_grid see

<div class="logo-grid"> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0964/0048/files/class_vi_web_large.png?12500854575707624221"> <img alt="gamma_compatible-logo-v2" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1064/0118/files/gamma_compatible-logo-v2.png?v=1732116689"> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0964/0048/files/bpafree_web_large.png?12500854575707624221"> <img alt="Made in Usa" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0964/0048/files/MadeInUSA_web_large.png?7582118775658440876"> </div>
here multiple logo url I added

it is possible to vbuild this system with shopify so I dont wantto manually goign and past html and manyally enter the text and descriptio in html
